//Shaping up with Angular
// Creating a Store Module

//The Flatlanders need a store to sell their gems and more! They need it really quick, Angular will do the trick!

// They have figured out how to manipulate time and space, allowing them to create three-dimensional gems. 
// The buying and selling of their gems has become a popular Flatlander practice and they believe the next step 
// is taking their wonderful wares to the fourth dimension (the web).

//Create a Module named gemStore so we can get started on this marketing journey.
var app = angular.module('gemStore', []);

//Attach the gemStore module to our HTML page with a Direct
//In the index.html file, add the ng-app directive to the html tag. this reference the first tag under DocType tag
//had to commentout the answer    <html ng-app="gemStore"> 

//In index.html, create a simple Expression to display a friendly "Hello, Angular!" message.
<h1>{{"Hello," + " Angular!"}}</h1>

//In order to add some behavior to our application, we need a controller. 
//Add a controller named StoreController to our gemStore application.
app.controller('StoreController', function(){});

//Attach the StoreController to the <body> tag. Be sure to alias it as store.
ng-controller="StoreController as store"

//In app.js, we've added a gem object to represent one of the products in our gemStore. 
//Assign it to the product property of StoreController so we can use them in the page.
this.product = gem

//Display the name of the product inside the <h3> tag.
{{store.product.name}}

//Display the price of the product inside the <em> tag.
{{store.product.price}}

//Not For Sale
//We've added two new properties to our product that we can use on the HTML side. The first of these two is canPurchase, 
//which is a boolean indicating if the product can be purchased. The second is soldOut which, as you can imagine, is a boolean 
//indicating if the product is sold out.
//Use these two new properties in our HTML page to solve the following objectives.

//Use a directive to ensure that we can only see the "Add to Cart" button if the canPurchase property is true.
ng-show="store.product.canPurchase"

//Our first gem is so popular that we've run out of stock already! Well, Flatlander gems are pretty rare, so it shouldn't be a 
//big surprise. Luckily there is a soldOut property to our gem. When a gem is soldOut, hide the .product element.
ng-hide="store.product.soldOut"

//Looks like the Flatlanders have discovered more gems for us to sell in the gemStore. 
//That's a relief! Follow the objectives below to add these new gems to the store.
this.products=gems;

//You know how to display all the products, don't you? Use the correct directive to display all the products in product row divs.
ng-repeat="product in store.products

//Using Filters
//In the previous challenge we practiced displaying the prices of gems in our index.html. The first gem, Azurite, 
//now costs $110.50 (due to supply shortages) but our current code doesn't display the price correctly.

//Use an Angular filter to display the price as a currency.
{{product.price | currency}}

//Displaying the First Image
//We've added images to all products as well â€“ like any self respecting store should have. A product has an array of images 
//we can use in our HTML. Let's get the first image to show on the page!

//We want to display the first full-sized image for each product. 
<img ng-src="{{product.images[0]}}" />

//Our 2-dimensional clients have worked hard to produce multiple images for their gems. Display all the thumbnails inside 
//our gallery without repeating yourself by using an AngularJS directive on the li.thumbnail element.

//Make the li's repeat for each image in the image array. Use the variable image as your identifier.
li class="small-image pull-left thumbnail" ng-repeat="image in product.images" >

//Now that we have image available from our ng-repeat let's replace the product.images[0] with it.
<img ng-src="{{image}}" />

//Many times a product will be ready to sell, but won't have images yet (like our first one). 
//In this case the images array will just be empty. Note the change in our gems array.
//We don't want to display the .gallery element if there are no images. Create an expression on our .gallery div to make this happen.

//Use the ng-show directive to make sure our image gallery is only displayed if a product has images.
div class="gallery" ng-show="product.images.length > 0">

//We just learned that cramming a bunch of logic into our HTML is kinda bad. 
//Let's start the Right Way with a Controller which will control our tabs.
app.controller('TabController', function(){});

//An empty Controller isn't much use. Do you remember why we needed a Controller at all? 
//That's right, we need to initialize the tab property. Go ahead and add that property now, setting it to 1.
app.controller('TabController', function(){
    this.tab=1;
  });
  
//In order to set the current tab, we'll need a setTab method to use in our HTML. 
//It should set the tab property of TabController to a value passed in.
app.controller('TabController', function(){
  this.tab = 1;
  this.setTab = function(selectedTab){
    this.tab = selectedTab;
  };
});

//We've got a setTab method. Now we need an isSet method that accepts a value and returns whether that value matches this.tab.
this.isSet = function(isSet) {
      return this.tab === isSet;
    };

//FULL Example within app.js
(function() {
  var app = angular.module('gemStore', []);

  app.controller('StoreController', function(){
    this.products = gems;
  });

  app.controller('TabController', function() {
    this.tab = 1;
    
    this.setTab = function(setTab) {
      this.tab = setTab;
    };
    this.isSet = function(isSet) {

//Using Review Controller 250 PTS
//Assign the review controller we just created to our form and use the alias reviewCtrl to reference it inside the form. 
//On submission of the form save the new review.

//Inside the form tag create a ng-controller attribute and assign it to the ReviewController with an alias of reviewCtrl.

<form name="reviewForm" ng-controller="ReviewController as reviewCtrl" 

//Inside the form tag create a ng-submit attribute. Set the value of the ng-submit attribute to call our new addReview function. 
//Remember to pass in product when calling the addReview function.
ng-submit="reviewCtrl.addReview(product)">

//Prefix all three ng-models with the controller's alias.

//Form Styling
//Give the defined classes in your css colors. See the magic of ng-invalid/ng-valid at work!

//For elements with both the .ng-invalid and .ng-dirty classes, give the border-color of red.
//Add a style for .ng-invalid.ng-dirty setting the border-color to red.

.ng-invalid.ng-dirty {
  border-color: red;
}

//For ng-valid && ng-dirty, give a green border-color
.ng-valid.ng-dirty {
  border-color: green;
}

//Showing CreatedOn Date
//It's time to show when a review was created using the createdOn property. Follow the task below to add this in.

Upon saving a review, we're running the addReview function in our app.js JavaScript file. 
Before the review is pushed onto the array, add to this.review a new property createdOn with a value Date.now().
this.addReview = function(product){
  this.review.createdOn = Date.now();
  product.reviews.push(this.review);
  this.review = {};
};

// In the review template, we're already displaying most of the information about our review. 
// Add the createdOn date to the review within the cite element. We want it to say "-<Author> on <date>".

//You can output the createdOn date for the review in a similar way to how we output the other attributes of the review.
<cite class="clearfix">{{review.author}} on {{review.createdOn}}</cite>

//Use the date filter on the createdOn property in the template.
<cite class="clearfix">{{review.author}} on {{review.createdOn | date}}</cite>

//Refactoring Description Tab
// Notice that we have created an empty html file called product-description.html. Separate out the Description 
// Tab's content into the new html file. Include the product-description.html in our index where it belongs.

//Separate out our description tab into product-description.html.
